# BeyondChats – Article Scraping & Enhancement System

## Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the BeyondChats technical assignment.  
The system scrapes blog articles, stores them in a database, exposes RESTful CRUD APIs using Laravel, enhances article content using external sources and an LLM workflow, and republishes the updated articles through the same API.

The implementation focuses on backend engineering, data flow, API design, and system integration.
